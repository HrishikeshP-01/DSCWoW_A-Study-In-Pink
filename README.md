# A Study In Pink
If ever a woman is harassed, it would give her the atmost relief if the first people who respond are the ones specially assigned to protect her. Our country's **Pink Police** comprises of a group of officers who dedicate their time to ensure that timely help is given to women and the perpetrators of the crime face their consequences.
## The Problem
At times when a woman is being harassed, the first people to respond won't necessarily be Pink Police. At times the criminals would also have escaped only to find loopholes in the law and make the lives of these women even more miserable.<br />
The optimal way to respond to a woman abuse report is to include atleast one female officer in the team or have personnel in the response team who have the know how to handle the situation. We aldready have that - The Pink Police. What we don't have is a method of ensuring that Pink Police are the first response teams that arrive at the site.
## Our Vision
We want to help in ensuring that **Pink Police are the first response teams that arrive at the crime scene**. <br />
This would not only **boost public morale** but also **act as a big relief from the psychological turmoil that the victim might have been forced to undergo**.
## Our Solution
At the Study In Pink we have used ML algorithms and Data Analysis to **find the optimal positioning of Pink Police so that they are at the most probable location of the scene of crime** and are at optimum distance away from all the possible locations so as to minimize response time as well as the usage of resources.
## What next ?
**We hope to collaborate with Bengaluru Police thereby using the precise geographic locations of the crime scenes in our data set and improve the accuracy.**
In short I want to do my part in making my home town a safer place for women.
## How we did it ?
There were over 4000 woman abuse cases reported in the last 10 yrs in Bengaluru according to The Hindustan Times. Although we couldn't get the precise locations of all the crimes we scraped what we could and randomized the rest and fed it to our ML algorithm to get the optimal locations for Pink Police placement.
